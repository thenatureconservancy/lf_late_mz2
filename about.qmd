## More information about LANDFIRE

[What is LANDFIRE?](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2022/3034/fs20223034.pdf){target='blank'}  LANDFIRE, Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and The Nature Conservancy, that provides landscape-scale geo-spatial products, vegetation models and tools to support cross-boundary planning, management, and operations.  

 

LANDFIRE Mission: LF's mission is to provide agency leaders and managers with a common "all-lands" data set of vegetation and wildland fire/fuels information for strategic fire and resource management planning and analysis. 

 

What does LANDFIRE provide? This multi-partner program produces consistent, comprehensive, geospatial data and databases that describe vegetation, wildland fuel, and fire regimes across the United States and insular areas. Use the LF Definitions Quality and Standards Report to learn how LF creates the data. Use the LANDFIRE Data Dictionary to help locate LF information.
