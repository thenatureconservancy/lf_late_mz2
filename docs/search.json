Most areas saw a loss of 60% or more.\nSome areas in the southern portion of the study area saw a net gain in late-successional forest.

    "text": "Introduction: Why Late-Successional Forests?\nLate-successional forests play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting ecosystem health. The forests we describe in this short web application are concentrated on the western side of the Cascade Range along the coast of Oregon, USA. The 2022 “Executive Order on Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies” highlighted the ecosystem resilience of these forests and noted their ecological significance to maintaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating a healthy, functioning water cycle (See Barnett et al., (2023) and DellaSala et al., 2022).\n\nClosed vs. Open Canopy\nLate-successional forests can also be difficult to define, from an ecological point of view. (Gray et al., 2023). For example they are often characterized as “closed canopy”, but this may not always be the case as disturbance-dependent ecosystems may have “open-canopy”, late-succession habitat. Further, riparian ecosystems may naturally have frequent ice scouring and/or flooding that removes some, but not all trees (e.g., Estes et al., 2023).\nLate-successional, fire adapted ecosystems can have frequent surface fires that keep the canopy relatively open while preserving older and taller trees (e.g., Mugnani et al., 2019) that are characteristic of this forest type. Broadening the definition of late-successional forests to include both closed and open canopy ecosystems provides a more accurate estimate of the remaining late-successional forests, aids in the identification of key areas for conservation and helps identify positive or negative trends.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Discussion\n\nSummary and patterns\nOverall, late-successional forests have declined from pre-European conditions to present-day. Our preliminary analysis suggests that on average, late-successional forests have declined 60%, with nearly all ecosystems losing open-canopy, and coastal ecosystems losing closed-canopy, late successional. However, some areas have experienced a gain in late-successional forests, perhaps due to fire suppression.\n\n\nOur contributions\nOur results demonstrate the importance of considering open canopy LS, especially in fire adapted ecosystems. If we only consider ‘closed-canopy’ late succession habitat, we may underestimate those areas. Consideration of both canopy types could lead to a fuller understanding of the ecosystems at hand, as well as increased forest resiliency and stronger and more inclusive management strategies moving forward.\n\n\nFuture directions"
