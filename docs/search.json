In general there has been a substantial loss of late-successional habitat in this area. Loss is calculated per ecosystem, and the percent is the same across each ecosystem’s footprint. We did not map where late succession occured historically as it likely moved around so we cannot calculate change at a per pixel level."

Most areas saw a loss of 60% or more.\nSome areas in the southern portion of the study area saw a net gain in late-successional forest. This is perhaps due to a history of fire suppression in the area, or an increase in different vegetation types. Land ownership includes land managed by USFS, BLM, and private landowners.\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Map of percent change in late successional forest.
