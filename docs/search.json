Our preliminary analysis suggests that on average, late-successional forests have declined 60%, with nearly all ecosystems losing open-canopy, and coastal ecosystems losing closed-canopy, late successional. However, some areas have experienced a gain in late-successional forests, perhaps due to fire suppression.\n\n\nOur contributions\nOur results demonstrate the importance of considering open canopy LS, especially in fire adapted ecosystems. If we only consider ‘closed-canopy’ late succession habitat, we may underestimate those areas. Consideration of both canopy types could lead to a fuller understanding of the ecosystems at hand, as well as increased forest resiliency and stronger and more inclusive management strategies moving forward.\n\n\nFuture directions"

LANDFIRE’s BpS suite is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime.\nFor example, each BpS, (i.e. “western hemlock douglas fir forest”) is accompanied by a description that includes information on its succession classes and a model which captures historical disturbances and estimated amounts of succession classes.\nWe used the Clip Raster tool in ArcGIS pro to extract the area of interest from a broader extent of the raster data.\n\n\nObtaining historical Percentages of Late-Successional Forests in Western Oregon - (from) LANDFIRE BpS**\nFor each BpS, we needed to get estimates how much late-open and late-closed forest would have historically been present. This information was developed in BpS state-and-transition models, and available in a couple formats:\n\nThe BpS Reference Condition Table obtainable by clicking “Reference Conditions” here.\nBpS description documents. We downloaded them by filtering for Map Zone 2 at https://landfirereview.org/search.php.\n\nExample - Below is a screenshot of a BpS model: 1. Boxes represent the succession classes, or structural stages of an ecosystem 2. Lines represent succession and disturbance pathways 3. What’s missing from the diagram? The quantitative, disturbance inputs from the model, or the outputs which include percent of each succession class that would have occurred historically (visit the LANDFIRE Vegetation Modeling site to learn more about the modeling process).\n\n\n\nAssessing Current Succession Classes\nWe used the LANDFIRE succession class dataset to estimate the percentage of each succession class that occurs (per BpS) on today’s landscape. Each pixel within a BpS is labeled “A through E” for the “reference” states, and includes labels for other categories such as agriculture and urban.\nStep 1: Use the “clip raster” tool to extract the area of interest from a broader extent of the raster data.\nStep 2: Do a ‘combine’ using the Combine Tool of the BpS and succession class data to get a dataframe with pixel counts of each unique combination of BpS and succession class to allow for estimating of the amounts of current succession classes per BpS.\nStep 3: Use the Join Field Tool to join the ‘BPS_NAME’, ‘BPS_MODEL’ attributes from the BpS dataset, and the ‘Label’ attribute from the Succession Class dataset (see output data example below).\nThe rules for defining the structural characteristics of each succession class are in the BpS descriptions, and are essentially combinations of height, cover and type.\n\n\nWrangling data exported from ArcGIS Pro\nOnce we have clipped, combined and attributed spatial data in ArcGIS pro, we need to do a little data wrangling in R to further prep the spatial data for mapping and to make some charts. In summary we:\n\nRead the combined data attribute table and supporting data tables from LANDFIRE into R (all located in ‘data’ directory in Git repo)\n\nBpS-Succession Class Combined attribute table (named “bps_scl_cmbn.csv”)\nSuccession Class Descriptions (named “scls_descriptions.csv”)\nReference condition percentages (named “ref_con_long.csv”)\nMap Zone 2 Biophysical Settings (named “bps_mz2.csv”)\n\nBuild and join in succession class ‘descriptions’ (e.g., ‘Late1-Closed’)\nDo a little cleaning, and make a new ‘join_field’\nCalculate reference and current acres per succession class per BpS\n\nClick the “Code” button to see code.\n\n\n\nCode\n## read in raw data and sclass descriptions\n\nraw_bps_scls &lt;- read.csv(\"data/bps_scls_cmbn.csv\")\n\nsclass_descriptions &lt;- read.csv(\"data/scls_descriptions.csv\")\n\nreference_percents &lt;- read.csv(\"data/ref_con_long.csv\")\n\nbps_mz2 &lt;- read.csv(\"data/bps_mz2.csv\")\n\n##  clean and prep raw combined data\n\nclean_bps_scls_cmbn &lt;- raw_bps_scls %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-c(4, 5)) %&gt;%\n  unite(\"join_field\", bps_model,label, sep = \"_\", remove = FALSE )\n\n## clean and prep sclass descriptions\n\nsclass_descriptions_clean &lt;- sclass_descriptions %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-c(4)) %&gt;% # remove column\n  rename(\"model_code\" = \"StratumID\",\n         \"scls_label\" = \"ClassLabelID\",\n         \"state_class_id\" = \"StateClassID\" ) %&gt;% # rename columns\n  unite(\"join_field\", model_code:scls_label, sep = \"_\", remove = FALSE ) %&gt;%\n  separate(state_class_id, into = c(\"age_category\", \"canopy_category\"), sep = \":\", remove = FALSE) \n\n\n## clean and prep reference percents\n\nunique_sclass_labels_ref &lt;- unique(reference_percents$refLabel)\n#print(unique_sclass_labels_ref)\n\nunique_sclass_lables_cmbn &lt;- unique(clean_bps_scls_cmbn$label)\n#print(unique_sclass_lables_cmbn)\n# does not have barren/sparse and there are differences, e.g., Urban-Developed between this and sclass label\n# will assume Barren/Sparse, NoData and Snow/Ice is minimal; will change \"Developed\" to \"Urban\" in reference df cleaning code \n\nclean_ref_percents &lt;- reference_percents %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  mutate(across('ref_label', str_replace, 'Developed', 'Urban')) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across('model_label', str_replace, 'Developed', 'Urban')) %&gt;%\n  rename(\"join_field\" = \"model_label\",\n         \"bps_name\" = \"bp_s_name\" )\n\n## need to winnow this df to only the bps model codes in MZ 2\n\nclean_ref_percents_mz2 &lt;- clean_ref_percents %&gt;%\n  filter(model_code %in% bps_mz2$BPS_MODEL)\n\n\n## create 'final' dataframe with reference and current sclass percents, acres and labels\n\n## first ref con and sclass descriptions\nfinal_df &lt;- left_join(clean_ref_percents_mz2, sclass_descriptions_clean) \n\n\n# looks OK, now full join to add reference percents then clean a bit\n\nfinal_df2 &lt;- full_join(final_df, clean_bps_scls_cmbn) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-c(6, 10, 13, 14)) %&gt;%\n  rename( \"cur_scls_count\" = \"count\")\n\n# now for the math: need count/acres per bps, cur sclass percents and differences\n\nfinal_df3 &lt;- final_df2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(bps_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(bps_count = sum(cur_scls_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(bps_acres = bps_count*0.2223945,\n         ref_scls_acres = bps_acres*(ref_percent/100),\n         cur_scls_acres = cur_scls_count*0.2223945,\n         cur_percent = (cur_scls_acres/bps_acres)*100) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(12:15, round, 0))\n\n# save to csv to explore in Excel, and reorder columns\n\n#write.csv(final_df3, file = \"data/final_df.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\n\nThe resulting final data table was then joined back to the combined BpS-Succession Class data in ArcGIS Pro for mapping."
