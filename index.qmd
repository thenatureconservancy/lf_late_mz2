## Introduction: Why Late-Successional Forests?

Late-successional forests, also referred to as o&d-g%owth or mature forests, play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting ecosystem health. Late-successional forests can be found at various elevations, from lowlands to montane and subalpine regions. 

The forests we describe in this short web application are concentrated on the western side of the Cascade Range along the coast of Oregon, USA. The 2022 ["Executive Order on Strengthening the Nation's Forests, Communities, and Local Economies"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/04/22/executive-order-on-strengthening-the-nations-forests-communities-and-local-economies/) highlighted the ecosystem resilience of these forests and noted their ecological significance to maintaining biodiversity (INSERT CITATION), sequestering carbon [DellaSala et al., 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.979528/full)), and regulating a healthy, functioning water cycle (INSERT CITATION) 

### Closed vs. Open Canopy

Late-successional forests can also be difficult to define, from an ecological point of view. ([Gray et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112723005844)). For example they are often characterized as "closed canopy", but this may not always be the case as disturbance-dependent ecosystems may have "open-canopy", late-succession habitat. Further, riparian ecosystems may naturally have frequent ice scouring and/or flooding that removes some, but not all trees (e.g., [Estes et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/natural-areas-journal/volume-43/issue-3/2162-4399-43.3.148/Riverscour-Ecosystems-of-Eastern-Unglaciated-North-America-A-Review/10.3375/2162-4399-43.3.148.pdf)). <<are you saying late-successional, riparian ecosystems? if so, let's add "late-successional" in front of riparian>>

Late-successional, fire adapted ecosystems can have frequent surface fires that keep the canopy relatively open while preserving older and taller trees (e.g., [Mugnani et al., 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/10/5/389/pdf)) that are characteristic of this forest type. Broadening the definition of late-successional forests to include both closed and open canopy ecosystems provides a more accurate estimate of the remaining late-successional forests, aids in the identification of key areas for conservation and helps identify positive or negative trends. 

Further, due to changes in disturbance regimes, for example dam creation and fire-suppression, these potential open-canopy late succession habitats may need restoration. <<I don't get this, needs to be rewritten>>

### Objectives

1) Using LANDFIRE vegetation products, we identify the major ecosystems for the study area
2) Using LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings Products, we identify the historical amount and distribution of late-succession forest in the western coast of Oregon and contrast this with the remaining forest (using LANDFIRE data from 2023)
3) Determine how the information above changes when we split late-succession into open and closed canopy types
