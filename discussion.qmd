## Caveats

* This analysis was done to explore broad trends over time and should be used as a launch point for localized, in-depth analyses.
* We were intentional in using the term 'late successional', as that is the language used by LANDFIRE in the [BpS models and descriptions](https://landfire.gov/bps-models.php).  This should not be mistaken as an 'old-growth' assessment.
* Reference conditions were modeled by experts using a mix of expert opinion, local data and literature.  The amount of input information could vary from BpS to BpS.  For more information on the modeling methods, see [Blankenship et al., 2021](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3484).



* Differentiation between open/closed canopy classes were determined in workshops led by local experts. <<DOCUMENTATION ON THEIR CRITERIA CAN BE FOUND HERE>>

## Discussion

### Summary and patterns

Overall, late-successional forests have declined from pre-European conditions to present-day. Our preliminary analysis suggests that on average, late-successional forests have declined 60%, with nearly all ecosystems losing open-canopy, and coastal ecosystems losing closed-canopy, late successional. However, some areas have experienced a gain in late-successional forests, perhaps due to fire suppression.

### Our contributions

Our results demonstrate the importance of considering open canopy LS, especially in fire adapted ecosystems. If we only consider ‘closed-canopy’ late succession habitat, we may underestimate those areas. Consideration of both canopy types could lead to a fuller understanding of the ecosystems at hand, as well as increased forest resiliency and stronger and more inclusive management strategies moving forward.
